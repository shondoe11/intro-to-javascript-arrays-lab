1) Replace 'pizza' in the `foods` array with 'sushi' and 'cupcake'.

Complete Exercise 6 in the space below:
*/

foods.splice(1,1,'sushi','cupcake')
console.log('Exercise 6 result:', foods);

/*
Exercise 7: Using the `slice()` method

1) Use the `slice()` method to create a new array that contains 'sushi' and 
   'cupcake'.

2) Assign it to a variable named `yummy`.

Complete Exercise 7 in the space below:
*/

let yummy = foods.slice(1,3)
console.log('Exercise 7 result:', yummy);

/*
Exercise 8: Finding an index

1) Using the `indexOf()` method, find the index of the string 'tofu' in the 
   `foods` array. 

2) Assign it to a variable named `soyIdx`.

Complete Exercise 8 in the space below:
*/

let soyIdx = foods.indexOf('tofu')
console.log('Exercise 8 result:', soyIdx);

/*
Exercise 9: Joining elements

1) Use the `join()` method to concatenate the strings in the `foods` array, 
   separated by ' -> '. 

2) Assign the result to a variable called `allFoods`. 

Note: The final result should log as:
'taco -> sushi -> cupcake -> tofu -> cheeseburger'

Complete Exercise 9 in the space below:
*/

allFoods = foods.join(' -> ')
console.log('Exercise 9 result:', allFoods);

/*
Exercise 10: Check for an element

1) Using the .includes() method, check if the `foods` array contains the string
   'soup'.

2) Assign the result to a variable called `hasSoup``.

Complete Exercise 10 in the space below:
*/

hasSoup = foods.includes('soup')
console.log('Exercise 10 result:', hasSoup);

/*
Exercise 11: Odd numbers from an array

1) Choose a method to iterate through the `nums` array.

2) Push each odd number to a new array named `odds`.

Hint: Initialize the `odds` variable to an empty array before the iteration.

Complete Exercise 11 in the space below:
*/

const nums = [100, 5, 23, 15, 21, 72, 9, 45, 66, 7, 81, 90];

/*
Exercise 12: FizzBuzz with arrays

1) Choose a method to iterate through the `nums` array. 

2. As you loop, sort the numbers into new arrays based on the following rules:

   - Push any number evenly divisible by 3 to an array called `fizz`.
   - Push any number evenly divisible by 5 to an array called `buzz`.
   - Push any number that is evenly divisible by 3 and 5 to an array called
     `fizzbuzz`.

   Note: A single number may meet more than one of the above rules. If it does,
         it should be placed in multiple arrays. For example, the number `15`
         will appear in the `fizz`, `buzz`, and `fizzbuzz` arrays.

Complete Exercise 12 in the space below:
*/
fizz = []
buzz = []
fizzbuzz =[]
for (let i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
  if (nums[i] % 3 === 0){

/*
Exercise 13: Retrieve the Last Array

1) Assign the last nested array in the `numArrays` below to a variable named
   `numList`. As you do this, also fulfill these goals:

   - Assume you don't know how many nested arrays `numArrays` contains.
   - Do not alter the original `numArrays` array.

/*
Exercise 14: Accessing within nested arrays

1) Retrieve the number `66` from the `numArrays` array. As part of this process
   do not alter the original `numArrays` array.

2) Assign it to a variable called `num`.

Complete Exercise 14 in the space below:
*/
num = numArrays[numArrays.length -2].slice(1)[0] //! used chatGPT to correct from: num = numArrays[numArrays.length -2].slice(1) --it says this code would work only partially, returning [66] and not the intended '66' value

/*
Exercise 15: Nested array sum

1) Use nested loops or `forEach()` methods to sum up all numbers within 
   `numArrays` nested arrays.
   
2) Assign the sum to a variable called `total`.

Hint: Be sure to declare and initialize the total variable before the iterations.

Complete Exercise 15 in the space below:
*/

    for (let j = 0; j < numArrays[i].length; j++)
